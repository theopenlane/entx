# entx

A helper package for working with [ent](https://entgo.io/), which includes the following high-level utilities:

- [Mixin](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-mixin) used for assigning a different ID type than the one generated by `ent` (we use ULIDs)
- [Mixin](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-mixin) used for assigning some default columns (`created_at`, `created_by`, etc. - check out the `mixin` directory for more details)
- A vanilla, drop-in, setup for using `ent` with our standard tool chains `gqlgen`, `gqlgenc`, and some other helpers
- Soft-delete extension with cascade delete functionality added in
- Multi-driver support for various databases
- SQLite connection interface management

## Usage

When using the generated `graphql` schemas, you must have the `Upload` scaler defined, which are used for the file upload resolvers:

```graphql
scalar Upload
```
